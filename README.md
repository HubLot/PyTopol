# PyTopol

Reza Salari - [Brannigan Lab](http://branniganlab.org)

### Introduction 

**PyTopol** provides utilities to convert certain molecular topologies to 
each other. Currently it supports converting NAMD `psf` files to GROMACS 
topology format. If you'd like to use GROMACS topologies in NAMD, plese 
see [here](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.9/ug/node14.html).

PyTopol follows a different approach than the force-field conversion tools and 
is intended to convert the full-topology of a molecule from one format to
another. This allows conversion of custom-parameterized topologies across
MD packages.


### Current stage
PyTopol is currently in *alpha stage*. The results for several 
systems are shown below which are encouraging. However, before using it for
production run simulations, more testing is required. 


### Feedback
If you have a question, found a bug or have a suggestion, please submit it

## Quickstart

#### Method 1 - using `pip` (python package installer)

    $ pip install pytopol 
    $ psf2top.py -p psffile -c charmm_prm1 [charmm_prm2 ...] [-v]

#### Method 2 - clone the git repo 

    $ git clone http://github.com/resal81/pytopol
    $ cd pytopol 
    $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
    $ cd scripts 
    $ python psf2top.py -p psffile -c charmm_prm1 [charmm_prm2 ...] [-v]


## Example run
For a protein+lipid `psf` system, the GROMACS topology can be generated by the
  follwing command. This assumes that name of the `psf` file is `system.psf` and
  you have the necessary parameter files in the same directory.

    $ psf2top.py -p system.psf -c par_all36_prot.prm par_all36_lipid.prm

You can add `-v` for debug information.


## Notes 

* `psf2top.py` converts the `psf` file to GROMACS topology format. It creates one
 `top.top` plus one or multiple `itp` files. Each segment in the `psf` file is converted 
 to one `itp` file. 

* `psf2top.py` only accepts NAMD formatted `psf` files, where the columns in the
  atoms section of the `psf` file are separated by at least one space. If this
  is the case for your `psf` file, make sure there is a `NAMD` keyword in the
  first line of the `psf` file.

* You should provide all CHARMM parameter files for all the atoms in your `psf`
  file. This typically corresponds to the parameter files that you use for your system
  when running the NAMD simulation. 

* The CHARMM stream files (with `str` suffix) are not supported. These are files that typically
  include both topology and parameters for a molecule. For these cases put the
  parameter section in a separate file before giving it to `psf2top.py`.

* For the CHARMM parameter files, the `NBFIX` and `HBOND` sections are
 currently ignored.

* If you use [CHARMM-GUI](http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/membrane) to generate inputs,
  make sure to use the `xplore` format for the `psf` file.

* Remove water molecules from the `psf` file before conversion. The tests for water topology
  conversion do not quite pass (see below). You can use `editconf` and `genbox` to add
  water to the system later on.



## Test systems 

I used `psf2top.py` to convert several `psf` files to GROMACS format 
  and then compared the resulting single-point energies using NAMD 2.9 and 
  GROMACS 4.5.7. 


#### Tests setup

GROMACS simulation was run using:

    $ grompp -f mdpfile -c pdbfile -p top.top -o topol.tpr
    $ mdrun -nt 1 -s topol.tpr -rerun pdbfile -g gromacs.log

NAMD simulation was run using:

    $ namd2 +p1 conf

#### Results 

Notes:
*  For these tests, first the `psf` file was created and then converted to
  GROMACS format.

*  The `psf` files for these systems are in `test/systems`.

*  For more info on automation of these tests, see `test/systems/README.md`.

*  Energies are in kcal/mol.

## Contribution
There are many ways you can help to improve **PyTopol**:

* Convert your `psf` files to GROMACS format and compare NAMD and GROMACS energies.
  Use the issues page to let me know of the potential discrepancies.

* Run simulations using the generated topologies and see if the results make sense.

* Fork this repo, implement improvements and send me a pull request.


## ToDo 
* Why the difference in bonding energies of water box is rather big?
* More tests
